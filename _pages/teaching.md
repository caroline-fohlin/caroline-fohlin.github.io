Research in Economics (499r)

Economics of Public Infrastructure Investments
This course takes an experiential learning approach to studying the economics of public infrastructure investments in the local community. Students will engage in real-world data collection, analysis, and problem-solving to understand how governments make decisions around financing and implementing infrastructure projects. 
 Through hands-on data analysis (and possibly also site visits and interviews with local officials) students will explore topics such as cost-benefit analysis, public-private partnerships, tax policy, budgeting, and economic development related to infrastructure. The course will cover a range of infrastructure areas including watershed, roads, and other public works. 
Students will explore: 
-- Analyze the economic tradeoffs and priorities involved in public infrastructure investment decisions 
-- Apply economic principles and data analysis to assess the costs, benefits, and overall value of specific infrastructure investments 
-- Develop recommendations for infrastructure investment strategies that balance economic, social, and environmental considerations 
 
This experiential course provides students with practical skills and knowledge to understand the complex economics underlying the public provision of critical community infrastructure. 

Research in Financial Economics
This course will engage the class in a small number of related financial economics research projects, emphasizing unique data sources, such as archives, periodicals, and qualitative textual analysis (e.g. political uncertainty, investor sentiment, earnings news). The course will take you through the various steps of developing important questions reviewing related literature, generating testable hypotheses, identifying and gathering the necessary data, planning and implementing the empirical methods, and presenting the results. Students need a solid background in statistical analysis and should preferably have some background knowledge in financial economics. We will explore and employ data extraction techniques using AI applications, so we can exploit novel sources and attack new research questions. By the end of the course, you should be able to conduct your own, independent (and collaborative!) research projects worthy of peer-reviewed, academic publication. 

Advanced Financial Markets (ECON433)
This course provides an advanced, technical study of financial markets using the latest theory and methods in the financial economics literature.  We study the design and efficiency of capital markets, asset pricing, and the microstructure of trading.   

Freshman Seminar (ECON190)
Money, Markets, and Manias
This course examines how money and markets have been driven by irrational exuberance and collective madness in the 20th century, leading to spectacular booms and busts in various sectors of the economy. It explores the historical origins, psychological mechanisms, and economic consequences of financial bubbles and crashes, such as the Roaring Twenties, the Great Depression, the Dot-com Bubble, and the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. It also analyzes the role of financial innovation, regulation, and social media in creating and bursting these bubbles. The course draws on historical sources, economic theory, and empirical evidence to provide students with a comprehensive and critical understanding of the history of money, markets, and manias in the 20th century. 

Money and Politics
This course examines how the economy works and what role government plays in various segments of the economy. On the flip side, we will study how money interests affect political decision making.  Based on a combination of historical events and current headlines, we will explore a range of issues and cases. For example, we explore various forms of government and how they organize economies and markets around the world and over time. Along the way, we will touch on financial systems and financial crises, central banking and monetary policy, fiscal policy and Congressional politics, the role of the US Supreme Court, public versus private goods, and much more!
