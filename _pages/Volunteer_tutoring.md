Together with community-minded Emory students (mostly economics majors), I offer tutoring and mentorship to kids and teens in Atlanta. We provide one-on-one homework help (K-12), college-readiness, and group SAT prep classes at the Bessie Branham Recreation Center (Kirkwood), at the Emory campus, and online.

Get in touch if you are interested in volunteering with us!
